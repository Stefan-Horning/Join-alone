        <h2>What is Join?</h2>
        <div class="wahtIsJoinContainer">
            <span>Join is an intuitive and user-friendly project management tool that allows teams to
                collaborate seamlessly and efficiently. With its kanban system, team members can easily track their
                tasks, deadlines, and progress in real-time.
                The kanban board displays tasks in different stages such as "To-do," "In progress," and "Done," allowing
                team members to quickly visualize the status of their projects. This makes it easy to prioritize tasks,
                delegate responsibilities, and track progress.
                Join also features a drag and drop interface, enabling users to move tasks across different stages with
                ease. This ensures that everyone is on the same page and eliminates the need for endless email threads
                or status meetings.
                Moreover, Join's customizable task cards allow team members to add detailed information such as
                descriptions, due dates, and attachments. This ensures that everyone has the necessary context and
                resources to complete their tasks efficiently.
                In summary, Join is an ideal tool for teams looking to streamline their project management process,
                boost productivity, and achieve their goals.

        <div>
            <div class="explainContainer">
                <p class="numberHelp">1.</p>
                <span>Click on the "Create Task" button and enter the task details such as title, description, category,
                    date, and priority. You can also assign the task to team members who are already in your contacts or
                    add new contacts from the "Contacts" menu.
                </span>
            </div>
            <div class="explainContainer">
                <p class="numberHelp">2.</p>
                <span>Once you have added the task, it will appear on the "Board" menu. Here, you can use the kanban
                    system to manage your tasks. Simply drag and drop the task cards into the appropriate column such as
                    "To Do," "In Progress," "Awaiting Feedback," or "Done."
                </span>
            </div>
            <div class="explainContainer">
                <p class="numberHelp">3.</p>
                <span>Use the "Summary" menu to get an overview of all the tasks. This menu displays which tasks are in
                    progress, which ones have deadlines, and which ones are already completed. This is especially
                    helpful for urgent tasks and allows you to quickly identify what needs to be prioritized.</span>
